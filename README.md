# Welcome to the selfhosted-anime guide!

## This guide will make **HEAVY** use of how TRaSH Guides sets up [hardlinks](https://trash-guides.info/), you should really give it a read beforehand.

This project uses **Docker** for its infrastructure and **Ubuntu Linux** as its operating system, so anything else is out of my scope (_unless contributed_). This will give you a **stable and reliable** solution to manage your anime movies and tv-shows while having **proper metadata**.

- **I will NOT be using Sonarr and Radarr.**

Along the way I'll explain how I did things **_my way_**, of course a lot of stuff can be changed and improved, that's up to you.

The containers that will be used are the following:

- qBittorrent
- Autobrr
- Shoko-Server
- Jellyfin

### You will have some automated downloads with Autobrr, but it's not like Sonarr or Radarr.

To dive in, read the [Getting started](guides/getting-started.md) page.
